  Get an iOS/iPadOS app through App Store review and keep it there — preparing a
  submission, reading App Store Connect instead of guessing, answering a 2.1
  information request, fixing a metadata rejection without a new build, and
  the App Store Connect traps that cost a round trip each. Use when the user
  says "submit to the App Store", "Apple rejected the app", "what's the status
  of the submission", "fill in TestFlight", "app privacy", "age rating", or
  anything about App Store Connect. Learned the hard way shipping Radiant for
  iPhone (two rejections, one lost day, a subtitle that was both rejections at
  once).

# App Store Review — what actually happens, and what to do about it

This is a working protocol, not Apple's documentation. Every rule in it was
paid for by a real round trip on a real app (Radiant for iPhone, 2026-08 to
2026-09). Where a rule looks paranoid, the reference files say what it cost.

It is model- and harness-agnostic. "Open App Store Connect" means: drive a
browser if you have one, and otherwise write the exact steps for the user. Only
the account holder can press Submit, reply to App Review, or upload a build —
prepare everything, then hand over, and never report a step as done that you
did not see finish.

## Rule zero: read App Store Connect before you trust anything

The status of a submission lives in exactly one place:

    https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/<app id>/distribution/reviewsubmissions

Not in your notes, not in the last commit message, not in the project file's
build number, not in what the user remembers. Every one of those went stale on
Radiant — a status doc said "Waiting for Review" for **nine days** while the
app had been REJECTED, and a whole day of work was done on a build that was not
in the queue at all. Reading the page costs one navigation. Do it first, every
time the task touches the submission, and write what you saw (status, build
number, date) into whatever record you keep, dated.

Corollary: **a prediction of why Apple will reject is worth nothing.** Radiant's
notes predicted guideline 1.2 twice; Apple raised 2.1, then 5.0.0 + 5.2.5. Do
not build a fix for a rejection that has not happened.

## The workflow

### 1. Before the first submission — the checklist

Work through `reference/checklist.md` in full. The items that bite:

- **The name must be unique across the whole store** and can be held by an app
  that never shipped. Have a second name ready.
- **Name and subtitle must not contain Apple trademarks** (`iPhone`, `iPad`,
  `Apple`, `Mac`). The description may mention them; the subtitle reads as
  branding and is held to guideline 5.2.5.
- **Say nothing that reads as another company's brand.** "Open AI models"
  (meaning open-weight) was read as **OpenAI** and triggered China's
  deep-synthesis rule (5.0.0). Write "open-weight" or "open models".
- **Every claim in the metadata must be true when a reviewer pokes at it.**
  "Fully offline" is false the moment the app accepts a cloud API key. A
  subtitle can be shorter than the truth; it cannot be bigger.
- **App Privacy has a Publish button.** Saving the answers is a draft. The
  submit button then refuses with "an Admin must provide information about the
  app's privacy practices", which does not sound like "you forgot to publish".
  Verifying a value reloads correctly is not verifying the section is done.
- **Age rating: do not chase 4+ with an app that generates text.** Answer as
  the closest shipped peer did (look them up on the store), plus whatever your
  app adds. A reviewer who types a rude question and gets a rude answer has
  caught a false declaration (2.3).
- **Review notes are capped at 4,000 characters** and a 4,151-character draft
  is refused with no useful message. Write them in a file, count, then paste.
- **Fetch every URL you enter** and check the *title* of what comes back. A
  site that answers 200 with its homepage for unknown paths makes a typo look
  fine.
- **Run the app on a physical device before uploading** if any code path
  cannot run in the Simulator (anything using Metal/GPU: MLX, Core ML on GPU,
  camera). "Verified in the Simulator" is not a claim you can make about it.

### 2. While it is in review — statuses and what they mean

| Status | Meaning | Do |
|---|---|---|
| Waiting for Review | in the queue | nothing; do not resubmit, do not touch the build |
| In Review | a person has it | nothing |
| Rejected — *Information Needed* (2.1) | not a violation; questions | answer in App Review **and** paste the answers into Review Notes; no button to press, the reply is the resubmission |
| Rejected — a guideline number | a finding | see step 3 |
| Pending Developer Release | approved, held | the user presses Release |
| Removed | you pulled it | a fresh submission is needed |

**"Missing Test Information" is a TestFlight warning, not an App Store one.** It
gates *external* TestFlight testing only and does not block review. It lives
under TestFlight → Test Information, a different tab with its own fields. Fill
it (it takes ten minutes; `reference/checklist.md` lists the fields), but do not
read it as a problem with the submission.

### 3. When it is rejected — read it like this

1. Copy the rejection text verbatim into your record, with the guideline
   numbers, the submission ID, the reviewed device, and the date.
2. For each citation, find **the exact field** that contains the flagged
   words. Apple quotes them. Search name, subtitle, description, keywords,
   promotional text, review notes, screenshots, what's-new — separately.
   One 30-character subtitle carried both of Radiant's citations.
3. Decide: **metadata-only fix, or new build?** Most first-app rejections are
   metadata. A metadata fix needs no upload and keeps the same binary.
4. Read Apple's *Next Steps* literally — they often name the cheap option
   (deselect the China mainland storefront rather than strip every OpenAI
   reference and hold an MIIT licence you do not have).
5. Make the edits. **Verify each by reloading the page.** App Store Connect
   greys its Save button whether or not the write reached the server.
6. Resubmit. For a metadata fix this is **two buttons on two pages**: on the
   version page, **Update Review** moves the item from Rejected to Ready for
   Review; only then does **Resubmit to App Review** on the submission page
   become enabled. The second is greyed out until the first is pressed, and
   nothing says so.
7. Record the new status, dated, and stop predicting.

`reference/rejections.md` has the three Radiant rejections in full — the text,
the field, the fix, the buttons.

### 4. When a new build is needed while one is in the queue

A submitted binary cannot be edited. Raise the build number (read it from the
project file — it has drifted from every note that recorded it), archive,
upload. While the state is *Waiting for Review* or *In Review*, use **Remove
this version from review** first, attach the new build, submit again — that
keeps the same version listing. Once it is *Pending Developer Release* or on
sale, the new build is an update instead.

### 5. After approval

Nothing in the store updates itself. Metadata edits (promotional text, review
notes, what's-new for the next version) do not need a build; the subtitle,
name, screenshots and description are tied to a version and change with the
next submission. Keep a list of "change on the next submission" items in your
record — Radiant's is the subtitle — and put it in front of the user as part of
the next build's checklist. Do not assume they remembered.

## Driving App Store Connect with a browser

- **Two kinds of fields refuse programmatic value-setting.** React-controlled
  inputs ignore `.value =` — the field stays empty and Save never enables. Click
  and type, or set through the native value descriptor and dispatch `input`
  then `change`. The TestFlight *Beta App Description* is a `contenteditable`
  div, not a textarea; a `querySelectorAll('textarea')` sweep misses it.
- **Reload after every save** and read the value back. Greyed Save proves
  nothing.
- **The "Publish" on App Privacy is separate from Save.** Look for it.
- **Storefront availability** is under Pricing and Availability, a different
  page from the version; deselecting a country there is what "not distribute in
  China" means.
- Only the account holder can sign in. Do not handle credentials; have them
  sign in, then continue.

## Screen recordings for App Review

Apple asks for one when they cannot see the feature work (2.1). Rules that each
cost a take on Radiant:

- **Check the status bar before believing an offline demo.** Airplane Mode with
  Wi-Fi re-enabled shows a Wi-Fi fan; Wi-Fi off with cellular up shows "5G+".
  The take that counts shows Airplane Mode on and *no* radio in the status bar.
- **Do not put a hallucination in front of the reviewer of an AI app.** A tiny
  model inventing history is not a demo. Use a prompt with a short, checkable
  answer (a haiku, a unit conversion).
- Record on a physical device; the Simulator is not accepted for this.

## Keeping the record

Keep one file in the repo (Radiant uses `docs/APP_STORE_LISTING.md`): every
metadata field's current text with its character count, the privacy answers and
why, the age rating answers and why, each rejection verbatim with the fix, and
a dated status line that says *when it was last read from App Store Connect*.
Headings that state a status go stale; prefer "checked 2026-09-10: Waiting for
Review, build 6" to "Waiting for Review".

## What this skill does not do

It does not decide the product's content policy, it does not enrol the
developer account, and it does not convert an Individual enrolment to an
Organization (that is a D-U-N-S number plus a support request, and it updates
the seller name on shipped apps without a resubmission — so it never blocks a
release).
